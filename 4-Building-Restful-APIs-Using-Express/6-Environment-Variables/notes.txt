LocalHost 3000 may work on your machine, but it isn't certain it work in 
production environment

When deployed to a hosting environment, 
the port is dynamically assigned by the hosting environment

It is set outside the application

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`)
});

$ export PORT=5000 (mac)
$ set PORT=5000 (windows)
