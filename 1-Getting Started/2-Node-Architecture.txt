Node Architecture
- Runtime Environment
The browser provide a run-time environment for JavaScript code
window.document.querySelector('...') - document object allow us to work in an environment in which our code is running 
In 2009, Ryan Dahl took V8 engine and embedded it inside a C++ program and called it Node (Node.exe)
The objects in the brower environment are most likely different from the server environment (fs.readFile(), http.createServer()) but we also have global objects (console.log()) that works both in the browser and server.
- Both Chrome and Node share the same JS engine but provide different runtime environment for JavaScript
- Node is not a Programming language.
