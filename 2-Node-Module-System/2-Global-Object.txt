console.log() - global object. It is part of the global scope which means we can access it anywhere in any files

Others
- setTimeout() - call a function after a delay
- clearTimeout  
- setInterval() - repeatedly call a function after a delay
- clearInterval() - stop the function from being called repeatedly

In the browser - run window on node v8 at runtime you get an error
window.console.log(), window.setTimeout, etc - the JavaScript engine will prefix the window object even if we don't specify it.

var = message = ''
console.log(window.message)

The variable, message is also available via the window object

In Node
In node it is global, not window - global.console.log(), global.setTimeout
But in node, 
var = message = ''
console.log(global.message)
the variable is not added to the global object. Message is only scope to the file. You will get undefined instead.

The variable, messageis only scped to the file,app.js. They are not available outside of the file. This is because of Node Modular System
