- We have scalable Node because of the Non-blocking asynchronous of Node
- The waiter is like a thread allocated to handle a request
- When we query a database, our request do not have to wait 
for the database to return the data
- While the database is executing our query, the database will be used to serve
another client
- The database compares the result and puts it in an event queue
- It continuously monitor this queue in the background
- When it finds an event in the queue, it will take it out an process it.
- This makes node ideal for lots of disc and network assess (all i/o-intensive apps)
- Node should not be used for CPU-intensive apps (like video encoding or an image manipulation service) because we have a lot of computation to be done by CPU and few operation that touch the file system with the network.
