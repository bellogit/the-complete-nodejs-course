A event is a signal that indicates something has happened in ur app.

In node the HTTP class is used to build a web server. So we listen on a given port and everytime we receive a request from the port, the HTTP class raises an event

We need to respond to that obj by reading the req and returning the right  response....

Different classes of node raises different type of events.

Node doc - Events - Class: EventEmitter - It is of the core building block of node. A lot of classes are bason this EventEmitter.

const EventEmitter = require('events); // uppercase shows it is a class...
A class is a container for properties and functions which we call methods.
Create a instance the class -which is an objct

class - Human (A class define the property and behavior of the concept of human)
object - John(Actual instance of that class) 

on or addListener does exactly the same
